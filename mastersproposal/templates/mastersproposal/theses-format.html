                  <p>Unless otherwise specified, the typical masters proposal seeks to provide a plan for future research that will encompass your larger thesis. It is a blueprint for your work. It illustrates, in detail:</p>

                        <ol>The primary purpose of the introduction is to provide the reader with an overview of the study itself and the influencing factors in its development.  This section should briefly introduce the setting and methods used in the study and present the study purpose and hypothesis.  The first two to three paragraphs of this section should focus on summarizing the nature of the thesis, including the writerâ€™s motivation for choosing the topic.  Next, the writer should discuss the significance of the topic in relation to the setting or the framework in which the study occurs.  In addition, the writer should include an acknowledgement of the prior research or information upon which the study is based.  The scope of the study should be presented, along with a general description of what the reader can expect in the remainder of the document.  Finally, the introduction should end with a brief discussion of what the writer anticipated will be the value of the research project.</ol>

                        <ol>The Literature Review provides the necessary background information to familiarize the reader with prior research and relevant theory.  Three general types of literature reviews exist:  the broad scan, the focused review, and the comprehensive critique.</ol>

                        <ol>The third chapter of the Masters Thesis is the Materials and Methods, sometimes also referred to as the Study Design and Methodology.  It is in this section that the writer describes the sample population and procedures used in enough detail that others could replicate the study and verify its validity.  This section should begin with specific data on the number of study participants, how they were chosen, and relevant demographic information.  The writer may also present the rationale for the specific sample size used.  Next, all tools and instruments used in the study should be described.  If such tools are described in detail elsewhere in the literature, the writer can indicate this along with a relevant reference.  Actual surveys or questionnaires will not be presented here.  Instead, the writer provides an overview and then inserts copies of the tools into the Appendix at the end of the paper.</ol>

                        <ol>The Results and Discussion portion of the thesis.  These two components should remain separated with the appropriate headings within this chapter, as they both serve a different function.  The results portion only presents the hard data without any accompanying analysis or interpretation.  This section should include, where possible, a visual representation of the data, such as in charts, graphs, or tables.  Each figure should have a brief description associated with it and clearly marked labels.  The results of all statistical analyses should be presented, such that the reader has enough information to determine reliability, validity, and the statistical significance of the relationships among variables.   This section should also be clearly organized by subheadings.</ol>

                        <ol>The final chapter of the Masters thesis is the Conclusions chapter.  Here is where the writer sums up the entire project in one to two brief paragraphs.  This chapter should remind the reader of the initial problem statement or hypothesis and then relate that to the results from the study.  The writer should then present any conclusions reached or any new insights that arose from this work.  Finally, the writer should present the research in terms of the overall impact in the field.  For example, how will the results of this study change the way a person or organization behaves or makes decisions?  One caution when writing this chapter is not to merely reiterate the other portions of the thesis.  Instead, the writer should strive to leave a lasting impression upon the reader, conveying with the same passion that drove the research project the importance of the work completed.</ol>
